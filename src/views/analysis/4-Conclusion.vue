      Since March 2020, stay-at-home orders and the rise of remote work have
      contributed to an unprecedented increase in curbside trash tonnage. The
      Streets Department struggled to handle the increase, with the citywide
      on-time collection rate declining to just 53% in FY21, well below its
      target goal of 80%. The impact on certain areas of the city have been even
      larger, with 8 of 13 sanitation districts averaging below 50% on-time
      collection during 2021. District 6L (lower Northeast) has experienced a
      significant increase in tonnage and has had an average on-time rate of
      only 31% in 2021. On the other hand, only two districts have had an
      average on-time rate above 70% in 2021 â€” district 2D (Center City) and
      district 3F (Northern Liberties/Fishtown/Kensington).

      While the on-time collection rate worsened during the pandemic, clear
      performance issues existed prior to the pandemic. Prior to FY14, the
      Streets Department consistently managed an on-time rate of about 95%, but
      following a compactor shortage in FY14, on-time rates declined. The
      Streets Department did not reach a sufficient level of compactors until
      late FY19. Meanwhile, curbside trash tonnage began to increase, and
      on-time performance never fully recovered to the level of earlier years.
      Performance has also varied significantly across areas of the city, with
      some sanitation districts, such as 2D in South Philadelphia and 4G in
      Northwest Philadelphia, almost never achieving a 90% on-time rate. This
      stands in stark contrast to trash collection in Center City, which is
      nearly always above 90%. One point is clear: trash collection, one of the
      core services of City government, is not equal in Philadelphia.
